## üöÄ Setup Project

Clone the repository and create a virtual environment:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/divyangi-pv/flowfabric-ai-agents.git
cd flowfabric-ai-agents

# Remove the existing broken venv
rm -rf venv

# Create a new virtual environment
python3 -m venv venv

# Activate it
source venv/bin/activate

# Verify it's working
which python3
which pip3

# Install requirements
pip3 install --upgrade --force-reinstall -r requirements.txt
```

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Environment Variables

Copy the example file and update it with your credentials:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Example `.env` file:
```env
# Jira Configuration (Required for Version Support Assistant)
JIRA_URL=https://yourcompany.atlassian.net
JIRA_USER=your_email@example.com
JIRA_TOKEN=your_api_token
```

### Getting Your Jira API Token

1. Log in to Jira and go to **Account Settings** ‚Üí **Security**
2. Click **"Create and manage API tokens"**
3. Click **"Create API token"** and give it a name
4. **Copy the token** (shown only once) and add it to your `.env` file

‚ö†Ô∏è **Security Note**: Never commit your `.env` file to version control. It's already included in `.gitignore`.

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Run MCP Server

Start the MCP server:

```bash
python3 run_server.py
```

Expected output:
```
[MCP] Server 'flowfabric-ai-agents' started (listening on stdio)
```

Now your MCP tools are available to assistants like **Amazon Q Chat in IntelliJ** or **GitHub Copilot**.

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### "Missing Jira credentials in .env"
- Ensure your `.env` file contains `JIRA_URL`, `JIRA_USER`, and `JIRA_TOKEN`
- Verify the API token is valid and hasn't expired
- Check that the Jira URL includes `https://` and the full domain

#### "Module not found" errors
```bash
# Ensure virtual environment is activated
source venv/bin/activate

# Reinstall dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

#### MCP Server not responding
```bash
# Restart the server
python3 run_server.py

# Check for error messages in the output
```

#### Git/Gerrit push failures
- Verify SSH keys are configured for Gerrit access
- Ensure you have push permissions to the target branch
- Check that you're in a Git repository with staged changes
