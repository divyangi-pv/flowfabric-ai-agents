# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature automates the release signoff process by streamlining ticket identification, version tracking, validation of changes, and communication. The system will automatically identify release tickets, extract version information from CI builds, validate associated Jira tickets for completeness, and notify stakeholders of any issues. This automation reduces manual effort and ensures consistent validation of release criteria before signoff.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a release manager, I want to automatically identify and process new release signoff tickets, so that I can initiate the validation workflow without manual ticket searching.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a new release ticket is created in ACCEPTED state THEN the system SHALL automatically detect the ticket
2. WHEN the system detects a new release ticket THEN it SHALL extract the release version number (e.g., 25.3.4)
3. IF the ticket format is invalid or missing version information THEN the system SHALL log an error and notify the user

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a release manager, I want to automatically retrieve previous version information from historical tickets, so that I can establish baseline versions for comparison.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN processing a new release ticket THEN the system SHALL locate the most recent previous release ticket
2. WHEN the previous ticket is found THEN the system SHALL extract the previous connector version and previous SDK version
3. IF no previous ticket is found THEN the system SHALL prompt for manual version input
4. WHEN version information is extracted THEN the system SHALL update the new release ticket with previous versions

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a release manager, I want to automatically extract current versions from CI builds, so that I can identify what changes need validation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN processing a release ticket THEN the system SHALL access the associated CI build URL
2. WHEN accessing the build THEN the system SHALL extract the build number and open the console output
3. WHEN parsing console output THEN the system SHALL search for com.tasktop.connector and com.tasktop.sdk version strings
4. WHEN versions are found THEN the system SHALL record current connector version and current SDK version in the release ticket
5. IF build URL is inaccessible or versions cannot be found THEN the system SHALL notify the user and request manual input

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a release manager, I want to automatically validate connector changes between versions, so that I can ensure all changes have proper Jira tickets and documentation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN current and previous connector versions are known THEN the system SHALL access the gerrit branch for the requested version
2. WHEN the gerrit branch for the requested version is known THEN the system SHALL query gerrit log for commits between versions/tag
3. WHEN processing each commit THEN the system SHALL extract Jira ticket IDs from commit messages
4. WHEN a Jira ticket is found THEN the system SHALL validate the ticket type is Defect, Story, or Security
5. WHEN validating tickets THEN the system SHALL verify fix version includes the new release version
6. WHEN validating tickets THEN the system SHALL verify release notes are written
7. WHEN validating tickets THEN the system SHALL verify ticket status is Done
8. IF a ticket passes all validations THEN the system SHALL add the Jira URL to the release signoff ticket
9. IF a ticket fails validation THEN the system SHALL send a Slack message to the ticket assignee with specific validation failures

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a release manager, I want to automatically validate SDK changes between versions, so that I can ensure all SDK changes meet release criteria.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN current and previous SDK versions are known THEN the system SHALL query gerrit log for commits between versions
2. WHEN processing each commit THEN the system SHALL extract Jira ticket IDs from commit messages
3. WHEN a Jira ticket is found THEN the system SHALL validate the ticket type is Defect, Story, or Security
4. WHEN validating tickets THEN the system SHALL verify fix version includes the new release version
5. WHEN validating tickets THEN the system SHALL verify release notes are written
6. WHEN validating tickets THEN the system SHALL verify ticket status is Done
7. IF a ticket passes all validations THEN the system SHALL add the Jira URL to the release signoff ticket
8. IF a ticket fails validation THEN the system SHALL send a Slack message to the ticket assignee with specific validation failures

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a release manager, I want to receive a comprehensive summary of the validation process, so that I can review all findings and take appropriate action.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the validation process completes THEN the system SHALL update the release signoff ticket with all findings
2. WHEN updating the ticket THEN the system SHALL include previous and current connector/SDK versions
3. WHEN updating the ticket THEN the system SHALL include all validated Jira ticket URLs
4. WHEN updating the ticket THEN the system SHALL include a summary of validation results
5. WHEN validation issues are found THEN the system SHALL provide a list of tickets requiring attention
6. WHEN Slack notifications are sent THEN the system SHALL log all notification attempts and their status

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to receive specific feedback about validation failures, so that I can quickly address issues with my tickets.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a ticket fails validation THEN the system SHALL send a Slack message to the assignee
2. WHEN sending notifications THEN the system SHALL include specific validation failure reasons
3. WHEN sending notifications THEN the system SHALL include the ticket URL and release version
4. WHEN sending notifications THEN the system SHALL include guidance on how to resolve the issues
5. IF Slack delivery fails THEN the system SHALL log the failure and attempt alternative notification methods

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the automation to handle errors gracefully, so that partial failures don't block the entire process.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any step fails THEN the system SHALL log detailed error information
2. WHEN a step fails THEN the system SHALL continue processing other steps where possible
3. WHEN critical failures occur THEN the system SHALL notify administrators
4. WHEN the process completes THEN the system SHALL provide a status report of all attempted operations
5. IF external systems are unavailable THEN the system SHALL retry with exponential backoff up to 3 times
