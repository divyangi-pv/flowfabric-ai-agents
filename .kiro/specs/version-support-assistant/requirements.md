# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Version Support Assistant is an MCP (Model Context Protocol) tool designed to automate and streamline the version support ticket triaging workflow in Jira. This tool enables AI assistants to interact with Jira tickets, manage their lifecycle, and integrate with Gerrit for code review processes. The primary goal is to reduce manual effort in handling version support requests and improve the efficiency of support teams.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a support team member, I want to fetch version support tickets from Jira, so that I can quickly review and triage pending tickets.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system receives a ticket fetch request THEN it SHALL retrieve tickets from Jira using the configured project and filters
2. WHEN no specific parameters are provided THEN the system SHALL default to fetching "Version Support" type tickets with "To Triage" status
3. WHEN the fetch is successful THEN the system SHALL return ticket details including ID, summary, status, assignee, creation date, and release notes URL
4. IF Jira credentials are missing THEN the system SHALL raise a runtime error with a clear message
5. WHEN the ticket limit is specified THEN the system SHALL respect the limit and return no more than the requested number of tickets

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a support team member, I want to add comments to Jira tickets, so that I can provide updates and communicate with stakeholders.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a comment is requested to a ticket THEN the system SHALL post the comment to the specified Jira ticket
2. WHEN the comment operation is successful THEN the system SHALL return a success status and comment ID
3. IF the comment operation fails THEN the system SHALL return an error status with descriptive error message
4. WHEN Jira credentials are missing THEN the system SHALL return a failure response with credential error
5. WHEN the ticket ID is invalid THEN the system SHALL handle the error gracefully and return appropriate error message

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a support team member, I want to update ticket status to "Accepted", so that I can move tickets through the workflow after review.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a ticket status update is requested THEN the system SHALL transition the ticket to "Accepted" status in Jira
2. WHEN the status update is successful THEN the system SHALL return a success confirmation
3. IF the status update fails THEN the system SHALL return an error status with descriptive error message
4. WHEN Jira credentials are missing THEN the system SHALL return a failure response with credential error
5. IF the ticket cannot be transitioned THEN the system SHALL handle the error and provide meaningful feedback

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to create Gerrit pull requests with proper commit messages, so that I can submit code changes linked to version support tickets.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a Gerrit PR creation is requested THEN the system SHALL commit all staged changes with a formatted commit message
2. WHEN the commit message is created THEN it SHALL include the ticket ID, description, and task URL
3. WHEN pushing to Gerrit THEN the system SHALL push to the specified branch with WIP (Work In Progress) flag
4. WHEN the push is successful THEN the system SHALL extract and return the Change-Id from Gerrit response
5. IF any git operation fails THEN the system SHALL return an error with the specific failure details
6. WHEN no repository path is specified THEN the system SHALL default to the current directory

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the tool to handle authentication securely, so that Jira and Git operations are properly authenticated.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system starts THEN it SHALL load environment variables from .env file
2. WHEN making Jira API calls THEN the system SHALL use HTTP basic authentication with username and token
3. WHEN Jira credentials are missing THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages indicating which credentials are needed
4. WHEN Git operations are performed THEN the system SHALL rely on existing Git configuration for authentication
5. IF authentication fails THEN the system SHALL provide descriptive error messages without exposing sensitive information

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a support team member, I want to extract release notes URLs from ticket descriptions, so that I can quickly access relevant release information.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN processing ticket descriptions THEN the system SHALL extract URLs that follow "Release Information:" text
2. WHEN the description contains structured content THEN the system SHALL parse nested content to find text elements
3. WHEN no release information is found THEN the system SHALL return null for the release notes field
4. WHEN the description is in plain text format THEN the system SHALL handle it appropriately
5. WHEN the description contains multiple URLs THEN the system SHALL extract the first URL after "Release Information:"
